      Olivia: Totally get it! 😄 So, besides pottery and your grad school
      adventures, any other cool hobbies or maybe some random fun facts about
      you? And hey, have you ever tried the pastries here? I've heard they're to
      die for!
    </p>

    <p style="font-family: monospace; text-align: left; padding-left: 20%">
      ME:yeah I'm a big fan of the croissants, do you know what they taste like?
    </p>

    <p style="font-family: monospace; text-align: right; padding-right: 20%">
      Olivia: Oh, croissants are my weakness! They're like fluffy clouds of
      buttery heaven, with that perfect crispy outer layer. I can practically
      taste them just talking about it. 🥐 And speaking of cravings, have you
      ever had those moments when you suddenly crave something super random,
      like pickles with peanut butter? Or is it just me being weird? 😅
    </p>

    <p style="font-family: monospace; text-align: left; padding-left: 20%">
      ME:oh my god it's my favorite snack!
    </p>

    <p style="font-family: monospace; text-align: right; padding-right: 20%">
      Olivia: No way! You're a fellow pickle and peanut butter enthusiast?
      That's amazing! It's like our taste buds are secretly best friends. 😂 So,
      when did you discover this delightful combination? And have you ever
      experimented with other unconventional snacks?

        ME:funny you should ask, I actually have a
        <i>list</i>
        that I created with my friend of different weird food combinations we
        want to try
      </a>
    </p>

    <p style="font-family: monospace; text-align: right; padding-right: 20%">
      Olivia: Haha, that sounds like a fun adventure waiting to happen! Care to
      share a sneak peek from your weird food combination list? I'm genuinely
      curious and, who knows, maybe we'll discover the next big food trend right
      here. 🍔🍦🌮

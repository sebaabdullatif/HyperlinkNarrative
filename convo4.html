      Olivia: That's a really creative and personal project! It's a great idea
      to document our conversation for your website; it'll give it a unique and
      authentic touch. Olivia: That's an intriguing approach, allowing the
      conversation to shape the narrative. It makes your project very
      interactive and engaging for the visitors. So, if you don't mind me
      asking, what inspired you to pursue a path in integrated design and media
      after your background in architecture? It seems like quite a shift.

      ME:well, my architecture program was very interdisciplinary so we were
      encouraged to experiment with different fields of study and I started
      taking computer science classes which actually helped shape my way of
      thinking when it comes to architecture. I think the two create an
      interesting combination especially if you think of architecture in the non
      traditional sense

      Olivia: That's a fascinating blend of disciplines! It must be exciting to
      see how architecture and computer science can come together to create
      innovative and unique perspectives on design. Could you share an example
      of how this interdisciplinary approach has influenced your thinking about
      architecture in a non-traditional sense? It sounds like a great way to
      push the boundaries of the field.

      ME: well, I'm actually doing this project right now where I have to tell
      my story through a website so I am actually documenting this conversation
      for it
    </p>

    <p style="font-family: monospace; text-align: right; padding-right: 20%">
      Olivia: That's a really creative and personal project! It's a great idea
      to document our conversation for your website; it'll give it a unique and
      authentic touch.
      <br />
      Is there a particular theme or message you're trying to convey with your
      story, or is it more about showcasing your journey through different
      experiences and conversations like this one?

        ME:I think it really depends on where this conversation takes us,
        whatever you would like to know about my life is sort of what anyone
        visiting the website is going to know

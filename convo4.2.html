      Olivia: That's a really creative and personal project! It's a great idea
      to document our conversation for your website; it'll give it a unique and
      authentic touch. Olivia: That's an intriguing approach, allowing the
      conversation to shape the narrative. It makes your project very
      interactive and engaging for the visitors. So, if you don't mind me
      asking, what inspired you to pursue a path in integrated design and media
      after your background in architecture? It seems like quite a shift.

      ME:well, my architecture program was very interdisciplinary so we were
      encouraged to experiment with different fields of study and I started
      taking computer science classes which actually helped shape my way of
      thinking when it comes to architecture. I think the two create an
      interesting combination especially if you think of architecture in the non
      traditional sense

      Well, one thing that really struck me was how technology can enhance the
      sustainability and functionality of architectural designs. With computer
      science skills, I've explored using data analysis and simulations to
      optimize energy usage and make buildings more eco-friendly. It's a bit
      like giving traditional architecture a high-tech makeover! ðŸ˜„

        What about you, Olivia? How did you end up in the world of graphic
        design?

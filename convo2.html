      Olivia: That's great to hear! A cafe with good coffee is like a second
      home for coffee lovers.

        ME:I am actually in grad school right now, so I usually just finish my
        <i>homework</i>
        here. What about you?

      Olivia: Grad school, huh? That's impressive! What's your field of study?
      As for me, I work as a graphic designer at a small creative agency. It can
      be pretty hectic at times, but I love the creative aspect of it. It allows
      me to express myself through art and design, which is something I've been
      passionate about for as long as I can remember.

      ME:Oh that's cool. I did my undergrad in Architecture but I'm in an
      integrated design and media program right now which is more like an
      artistic computer science program. What kind of projects do you have?
    </p>

    <p style="font-family: monospace; text-align: left; padding-left: 20%">
      Olivia: Wow, architecture and now integrated design and media? That sounds
      like a fascinating journey! In my graphic design role, I've had the chance
      to work on a variety of projects. We do branding and identity work for
      businesses, create marketing materials like brochures and posters, design
      websites, and even dabble in some animation and video production from time
      to time. It's quite a diverse range of projects, which keeps things
      interesting. Do you have any exciting projects you're working on as part
      of your program?

      Olivia: Those combinations sound like a wild culinary journey! Chocolate
      and chips is a classic sweet-salty combo, and I've heard folks raving
      about fries with powdered sugar. Chocolate on cheese pizza and peanut
      butter on a hamburger, though, that's next-level creativity! Have you
      actually tried any of these, or are they all on your foodie bucket list?
      😄🍔🍫

    <p style="font-family: monospace; text-align: left; padding-left: 20%">
      ME:no not yet, but they're on the bucket list- what about you?
    </p>

    <p style="font-family: monospace; text-align: right; padding-right: 20%">
      Olivia: Oh, I'm definitely intrigued by your list, but I can't say I've
      ventured into those territories myself... yet! I'm more of a
      traditionalist when it comes to food, but you've got me curious now. Maybe
      I'll join you on this culinary adventure someday! 😁 By the way, do you
      have any exciting plans for the weekend? Or are you just going to chill
      and enjoy the cafe vibes?

      ME:oh I actually have a booked weekend, my family is coming so I'm
      probably gonna show them around New York and sort of let them lead the
      weekend with what they want to do
    </p>

    <p style="font-family: monospace; text-align: right; padding-right: 20%">
      Olivia: That sounds like a fantastic weekend ahead! Showing your family
      around New York is such a great way to spend quality time together. Do
      they have any specific places or attractions they're really excited to
      visit? And if you need any insider tips on must-see spots or hidden gems,
      just let me know – I've been living in the city for a while! 🗽🏙️

        ME:I actually have a really long
        <i>google maps list</i>
        of all the places I need to go to
      </a>
    </p>

    <p style="font-family: monospace; text-align: right; padding-right: 20%">
      Olivia: That's super organized! 😄 Having a Google Maps list makes it so
      much easier to plan and explore the city. It's like your own personal
      treasure map of all the exciting places to visit. If you ever want to
      share some of those hidden gems from your list, I'd love to hear about
      them. Who knows, I might discover a few new favorites! 🗺️🌆

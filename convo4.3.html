      Olivia: That's a really creative and personal project! It's a great idea
      to document our conversation for your website; it'll give it a unique and
      authentic touch. Olivia: That's an intriguing approach, allowing the
      conversation to shape the narrative. It makes your project very
      interactive and engaging for the visitors. So, if you don't mind me
      asking, what inspired you to pursue a path in integrated design and media
      after your background in architecture? It seems like quite a shift.

      ME:well, my architecture program was very interdisciplinary so we were
      encouraged to experiment with different fields of study and I started
      taking computer science classes which actually helped shape my way of
      thinking when it comes to architecture. I think the two create an
      interesting combination especially if you think of architecture in the non
      traditional sense

      Well, I was always into art and design since I was a kid, you know,
      drawing all over my notebooks in school. When it was time to pick a
      career, graphic design felt like the natural choice. It's a way for me to
      blend my love for creativity with something practical. Plus, I get to make
      things look cool! What about you, any hobbies or interests outside of your
      studies?

        ME:Yeah actually, I started getting into
        <i>pottery</i>
        during covid and I enjoy it. I wouldn't say I'm great at it but I like
        how it fully occupies my thoughts while I'm working on it.
